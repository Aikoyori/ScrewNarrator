# Screw Narrator
Disables Narrator but it's simpler in terms of implementation.

## Why?
I played my own modpack and then i kept pressing control+b and i am so annoyed

## sync this with certain music
*The keybind is simple, it's true*

*Though, Control plus B will jump scare you*

*Know what, screw Narrator.*

*You know what, screw Narrator.*

*You know what, scre-e-e-e-e-e-e-ew Narrator.*
